# Aegis Security

Aegis Security is an AI-powered tool designed to help users, regardless of their technical expertise, understand how and where their sensitive information is being collected and utilized. Every year, we agree to dozens of Privacy Policies, Terms of Service, and EULAs‚Äîmost of which we never read. This gives companies, both large and small, the opportunity to obscure data collection practices within lengthy legal documents filled with jargon. As a result, companies are incentivized to use predatory data collection tactics, relying on the fact that most users don‚Äôt read or fully understand what they‚Äôre agreeing to.

Aegis Security aims to change this. By providing clear, actionable insights about privacy implications and user rights, we hope to push companies toward collecting less data or being more transparent about what they collect to remain competitive. Though the project is in its early stages, we are passionate about its development and are continually refining its capabilities.
